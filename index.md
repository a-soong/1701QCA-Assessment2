Microbit: My robot asks me for money

I found this video while researching for Assessment 1 and it was an inspiration for my project. It's a robot with a simple function made possible by the micro:bit. A small detail I liked was the sound of the coin container slapping back on the table after storing the coins - it unintentially gives the robot character.

Similarly to the first related project, it's another cute robot friend. Seeing this project made me consider putting movement in my project, but it did definitely give me ideas on how to give my coinbank some personality.

A popular interactive toy that has a simple sensor to detect the weight of the coin, and then a character that grabs the coin. Video attached shows the mechanisms inside.

An interactive coin bank by Moose toys. I don't think this product was a huge success but it caught my eye when I was young. When a coin is inserted, a sequence of animation appears on the screen. Counts the money inserted in the bank and has various other interactive options.

## Other research ##
I've had a look into what I could use to implement the motion sensing for this project. I have a ultrasonic sensor lying around but I don't think that'll do the job. After some research into other projects I found a Arduino Compatible PIR Motion Detector Module (https://www.jaycar.com.au/arduino-compatible-pir-motion-detector-module/p/XC4444), but after having spoken to a Jaycar Representative they've let me know that I'd need a T-Adaptor shield. Because of self isolating as well, I've decided against this and I had the idea of implementing a similar design inspired by my timing gates project. 

By using cardboard and aluminium foil to detect the movement of the coin as it enters through the slot, I can get the micro:bit to play a sequence of tunes when this event occurs.
